# DeepPoseIdentifcation

## Objective

Detect human position on 2D camera using OpenPose and some deepLearning technology.
Be able to labelise images depending on people attention for security purpose.   

## Dataset

The dataset comes from two different sources, 50% of the images found on internet, 50% own 
images. 

## OpenPose

## Neural Network

We are using TFLearn to construct our deepLearning algorithm.
