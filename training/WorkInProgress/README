### Work in progress

# ML_classification.py:

Visualisation of the data through TSNE projection

Prototype of several machine learning methods such as:

- ada boost
- random forest
- Perceptron neural net
- KNN
- SVC
- Gaussian process classifier
- Decision tree classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Quadratic discriminant analysis

Goal: Gain some insight on the data

# training.py:

First Neural network made with tflearn. But no results at all.
The program does not learn during the training process.
